# fertilizer_forecasting

Project Overview:The objective of this project is to develop a web-based fertilizer 
recommendation system that utilizes IoT sensors and ML classification model. 
The system aims to predict suitable fertilizer recommendations based on user 
inputs of crop type, soil type and the automated collection of temperature, 
humidity, and soil moisture data using IoT sensors connected to an Arduino 
device, providing a convenient and efficient solution for farmers.

Description of the project:
The Smart Farming System project emerges as a pivotal initiative designed to 
revolutionize agricultural practices on a broader scale, transcending regional 
boundaries and catering to the needs of farmers worldwide. Recognizing the 
universal challenges faced in agriculture, particularly regarding inefficient 
fertilizer usage and the absence of personalized recommendations, the project 
adopts a holistic approach. Through the strategic integration of Internet of Things 
(IoT) sensors and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, the system seeks to 
provide farmers with a sophisticated toolset for precision farming. By collecting 
real-time data on soil conditions and environmental factors, the technology 
generates accurate and personalized fertilizer recommendations applicable to 
diverse crop fields. This project endeavors to empower farmers globally, offering 
a solution that optimizes resource usage, enhances crop yields, and contributes to 
sustainable agricultural practices. The overarching goal is to bridge the 
technological gap in agriculture, making advancements accessible to farmers 
irrespective of their geographical location, and fostering a more resilient and 
efficient global farming community.
